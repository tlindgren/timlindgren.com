I work as a Senior Senior Learning Experience Designer in the [Center for Digital Innovation in Learning][1] at Boston College.

My interests include educational technology, web design, user experience design, faculty development, and
formative education.

I have a B.A. in English from Wheaton College (IL) and a PhD in English from Boston College (2009). My [dissertation research][2] focused on blogging and how writers use new media to help foster a deeper sense of place.

I'm thinking a lot about [formative education][2] – educating the whole person for meaning and purpose – in my work at Boston College. Specifically, I'm trying to help the group I'm in – the Center for Digital Innovation in Learning – define what "digital formation" might mean at BC.

I'm working with Professor [Belle Liang][3] on a couple of projects that have a formative education approach:

- We worked to together to develop her course new online course called "**Preparing the Whole Person for Global Citizenship**, which she is teaching first time this summer.
- We're also collaborating on the second version of [TrueNorth][4], an app designed to help young people foster a sense of purpose and make better decisions.

  I'm experimenting with <Link href="/roam-research">Roam Research</Link> for
  personal knowledge management. It's making me think in entirely new ways about
  how I think – how I take notes, how I develop ideas, how I write.
