      Our Tools Matter
    </Heading>
    Designers care about their tools since no technologies are neutral and they often
    shape us more than we realize.

      Design for the Whole Person
    </Heading>
    We should bring our whole selves to the design process and try to account for
    all aspects of students as they learn - intellectual, emotional, physical, social,
    spiritual - as well as the contexts in which learning happens.
