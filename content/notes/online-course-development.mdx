<Heading as="h3"> Teaching Writing Genres</Heading>

Maria Brisk is a Professor in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College and an expert in genre-based pedagogy for teaching elementary school writing.

I helped Dr. Brisk design three month-long courses that take the core elements of her classroom teaching and in-school trainings and translate them into an online learning format.

- Reports and Explanation Writing

I collaborated with Drs. Hans de Wit and Laura E. Rumbley from Boston College’s <Link href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/lsoe/sites/cihe.html">Center for International Higher Education</Link> to develop courses for a new masters program in global higher education.

The program is an interesting hybrid of face-to-face and online courses in which students have the option of residency in Boston during certain terms and only online courses in other terms. This mix of face-to-face and online format is a key component in providing flexibility for a global student clientele who are also pursuing worldwide field placement opportunities.
