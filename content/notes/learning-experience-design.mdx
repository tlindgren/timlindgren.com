I'm a Senior Senior Learning Experience Designer in the [Center for Digital Innovation in Learning](https://www.bc.edu/cdil) at Boston College. My job is to support teachers in creating the best possible learning experiences for their students.

I've worked in educational technology, faculty development, and online learning for 20 years, primarily in higher education contexts.

Learning Experience Design is a relatively new umbrella term for a field that weaves together educational technology, instructional design, learning, science and user experience (UX). It takes a holistic approach to the complex experience of learning (and of teaching) and tries to take into account all the factors that might be at play when we learn. For more on this, see [[What is Learning Experience Design?]]

## My Approach to Learning Design

      Everyone is a Designer
    </Heading>
    I want to help teachers and learners expand their toolkits for learning with
    relevant technology, insights from learning sciences, and sound pedagogy.

      Care about Your Tools
    </Heading>
    Designers care about their tools since no technologies are neutral and they often
    shape us and our work more than we realize.

      Design for the Whole Person
    </Heading>
    We should bring our whole selves to the design process and try to account for
    all aspects of students as they learn - intellectual, emotional, physical, social,
    spiritual - as well as the contexts in which learning happens.
