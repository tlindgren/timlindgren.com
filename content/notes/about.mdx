I work as a Senior Senior Learning Experience Designer in the [Center for Digital Innovation in Learning](https://www.bc.edu/cdil) at Boston College.

My interests include educational technology, web design, user experience design, faculty development, and
formative education.

I have a B.A. in English from Wheaton College (IL) and a PhD in English from Boston College (2009). My [dissertation research](https://mediakron.bc.edu/placeblogging) focused on blogging and how writers use new media to help foster a deeper sense of place.

## Now

A few things that I'm doing at the moment (see [now page](https://sive.rs/nowff))

<h3 mb="5" mt="8">Work </h3>

I'm currently busy helping four Boston College professors develop online
courses, due to launch in the Fall and Spring this year.

I manage front-end development and theme design for online programs using [[Design Tools]] in Canvas. Some examples of my work were recently select for the [Cidilabs DesignPlus Showcase](https://showcase.cidilabs.com/boston-college/).

I'm thinking a lot about [formative education][2] – educating the whole person for meaning and purpose – in my work at Boston College. Specifically, I'm trying to help the group I'm in – the Center for Digital Innovation in Learning – define what "digital formation" might mean at BC.

I'm working with Professor [Belle Liang][3] on a couple of projects that have a formative education approach:

- We worked to together to develop her course new online course called "**Preparing the Whole Person for Global Citizenship**, which she is teaching first time this summer.
- We're also collaborating on the second version of [TrueNorth][4], an app designed to help young people foster a sense of purpose and make better decisions.

I'm working on redeveloping this website with the goals of getting better at learning in public and tending my digital garden.

I'm experimenting with [Roam Research ](https://roamresearch.com/) for personal knowledge management. It's making me think in entirely new ways about how I think – how I take notes, how I develop ideas, how I write.

Since Covid hit Boston in March, I've been taking photos on my daily walks in Franklin Park in Boston, about a block from where I live.
