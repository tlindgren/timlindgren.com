# MediaKron

I'm also the product manager and lead front-end developer for [MediaKron][3], an online toolkit for digital curation and storytelling developed at Boston College. MediaKron is designed to provide a user-friendly and sustainable way to build digital projects in educational settings.

I've been involved with MediaKron since its inception in 2007 but during the last year have overseen a re-visioning and redevelopment of the application. I work closely with with Brad Mering, the lead developer on the project, as well as colleagues in the CTE, the Boston College Library, and faculty and students at both Boston College and our partner universities.
