## How I Built It

This site is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Reflex](https://reflexjs.org/).

It's currently under a lot of construction, so check out the <Link href="/changelog">Changelog</Link> for what's new.

I working on documenting the technical details on the [[website tech notes]] page. Everthing is Githubt as well if you want to dig around more.
